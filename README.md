## Recipe App

The purpose of this project was to create a recipe app where you can search through different recipes and get instructions for said recipe. I am fetching the recipe data from [theMealDB](https://www.themealdb.com/) which is a free (only for developing) API.

The plan is to add a backend to this where you can login and save your favorite recipes to a Postgress database that will be hosted on Heroku

This project is based off [app-ideas](https://github.com/florinpop17/app-ideas/blob/master/Projects/1-Beginner/Recipe-App.md), which is a brilliant GitHub Repository if you need ideas for your next project
